IAM - Summary

IAM Consists of the following:
 - Users
 - Groups (A way to group our users and apply polices to them collectively)
 - Roles
 - Policy Documents
 	
 	Ex: // Admin Access
 	    {"Version":"2018-07-01",
 	     "Statement":
 	     [
 	      {"Effect":"Allow",
 	       "Action":"*",
 	       "Resource":"*"}
 	     ]
 	    }
 	
 - IAM is universal, It does not apply to regions at this time.
 - The "root" is simply the account. Is has complete Admin acces
 - New Users have NO permissions when first created.
 - New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created
 - These are not the same as a password, and you cannot use the Access Key ID &
   Secret Access Key to Log into the console.  You can use this acss AWS via the
   APIS's and Command Line however.
 - you can generate the credentials only once and download as a csv
 - Always setup Multifactor Authentication on your root account
 - You can create and customize your own password rotation policies
