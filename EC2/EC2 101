EC2 101 - Complete notes from Udemy course for EC2

Def: What is EC2 ?
Amazon Eclastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.  Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to botain and boot new server
instances to minutues, allow you to quicly scale capacity, both up and down as your computing requirements change.

==============================================================================================

Pricing models

1. On Demand
	- Perfect for users that want the low cost and flexibilty of Amazon
	  ECS without and up from payment or long-term commitments
	- Applications with short term, spikey or unpredicatble work loads
	- Applications being developed or tested
2. Reserved Instances
	- Applicastion with steady state or pedictable usage
	- Applications that require a reserved capacity (ie webserver)
	- users can make up front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
	- Standard Costs Reserved instances (Rls) (up to 75% off on-demand)
	- Convertible RLS (up to 54% off on-demand) features the capacity to change
	  the attributes of RI as long as the exnage results in the creation of RI's of equal or greater value
   Reserved Intances Scheduled
	- Applications with steady state or pedicable usage
	- Applications that require reserved capacity
	  Users cna make up-front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
   - Convertible RLS (up to 54% off on-demand) features the capacity to change
	  the attributes of RI as long as the exnage results in the creation of RI's of equal or greater value
	- Scheduled RI's are available to launch within the time window you reserve.  This option allows your to 
	  match your acpacity reservation to predicable schedules
3. Spot Insance
   - Applications that have flexible start and end times
   - Applicaitons that areonly feasable at very low compute prices (IE genetics, pharms)
   - Users that urgent need immediate RI's to take care of occasional
 4. Dedicated hosts
 	- Useful for regualatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
 	- Create for licensing which does not support muli-tenancy or cloud deployment
   - can be purchased on-demand(hourly)
   - Can be purchase as a Reservation for up to 70% of online demand pricing

  Def What is EBS ?
  Amazon EBS allows your to create storage volumes and attach them to
  Amazon EC2 instances.  Once attached, you can create a file system on top of
  these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you use a block device.
  Amazon EBS volumens are places in a specific Availablity Zone*, 
  where they are automatically replicated to protect you from failure of a single component
  
  EBS Volume Types
  1. General Purpose SSD (GP2)
  	- Ratio of 3 IPOS per GB with upto 10,000 IPS and abilty to burst up to 30,000 IOPS
  	      for extend periods of time for volums up to 3334 GiB and above
   - General purpose both price and performance
  2. Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
   - Designed for I/O intensive (DB's ect)
   - Use if you need more than 10000 IOPS
   - Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per Volume
  3. Throughput optimized HDD (ST1)
   - Big data/ data wherehousing
   - Log processing
   - cannot be boot volume
  4. Cold HDD (SC1)
  	- Low cost storage, infrequntly used data
  	- File server
  	- cannot be a boot volume
  5  Magnetic Standard
    - Lowest coset of the types that is bootable
    - Good for workloads where data is accessed infrequently
    
 		
  Exam Tips
   - know pricing models - (on demand,reserve,spot,dedicated servers)
   - If spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2 (ie price change),  you do not pay for partial hours
     if you termate an instance you will be charged for partial hours
   - Be familiar Fight Dr McGiftpx ancronym for instance types
   - Know different EBS types
   	- SSD 
   		- General purpose SSD (GP2) upto 10000 IOPS
   		- Provisioned SSD (IO1) > 10000 IOPS
   	- Magnetic
   	 - Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1) frequently accessed workload
   	 - HDD Cold (SC1) less frequenty accessed data
   	 - HDD Magentic - Stanard cheap can be a boot volume
    - You CANNOT mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS

Security Groups Lab:
	Security Group is a Virtual Firewall
	- All inbound traffic is block by default
	- All outbound traffic is allowed
	- changes to a security group apply immediately
	- you can have multiple EC2 instances within a security group
	- you can have multiple security groupls assigned to one EC2 instance
	- Security Groups are STATEFUL 
		- if your create an inbound rule allowing traffic in,
		  is automatically allowed back out again
   - you CANNOT block specific IP address from Security Grups, only from
     Network Access Control Lists
   - you CAN specify allow rules, CANNOT define a deny rule
  		
=======================================================================================================	
Upgrading EBS Volume Types - Lab  
	- You CANNOT mount drives accross availability zones
	- Root device has to be in same availability zone
	- you cannot modify every type except standard magnetic
	- you can create another volume from a snapshot, then create a new volume new availability zone
	- To move then create a snapshot, then move to new zone
	
	- Volumes exist on EBS:
		- Virtual HDD
	- Snapshots exist on S3
	- Snapshots are incremental in time of Volumes
		- Only blocks saved that are changed
	- You should stop instances before taking a snapshot of root volume, not required
	- You can create AMI's (Amazon Machine Image) from both Volumes and Shapshots
	- You can change EBS volume on the fly, both size and storage (best practice is to stop)
	- Volumes will ALWAYS be in the same availability zone as the EC3 instance
	- To move a volume between AZ then take a snap or AMI and then copy to another AZ
	- Snapshots are encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically
	- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
	- You can share snapshots only if unencrypted
		- These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public


======================================================================================================  		
  EFS Elastic File System - Lab (Not in Exam) - COOL STUFF THE FUTURE, GET ON TOP OF THIS FOR JOB
  Def: Amazon EFS is a file storage service for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2 instances
       Amazon EFS is east to use and provides a simple interface that allows you to create
       and configure file systems quickly and easily.  With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is
       elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as needed.
  - allows E
  - EFS Features
  	- Supports the NFS v4
  	- You only pay for the storage you use (no pre-provising required)
  	- can scale up to petabyes
  	- can support thousands of concurrent NFS Connections
  	- Data is stored accross multiple AZ's with a regions
  	- Read and Write Consistency
  	
  ======================================================================================================  	
  The AWS CLI - Using Credentials Lab
   - Create User with programatic access and EC2 instance
   - use terminal to login as normal wth instance IP
   - use sudo su
   - aws s3 ls (unable to locate credentials)
   - aws configure use users key and secret key
   - enter region name
   - use default output (none)
   - aws s3 ls - will display all of your s3 buckets
   - cd ~/.aws
   - you will see two files (credentials)
   - CAUTION leaving this key with port 22 open will allow any others to login if they have your credential,private key
   - DON'T upload to GitHub
   - More secure way to do this is to use roles
   - Terminate:
   	- aws ec2 desribe-instances (locate instance, then copy InstanceId
   	- aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-id (InstanceId#)
   	- Should terminate and close termainl login
   - Go back to console and delete the created user with progamatic access
   
  ======================================================================================================
   The AWS CLI - Using Roles Lab
   - Create Role in console, use S3FullAccess
   - create ec2 instance and assign role
   - ssh login and sudo su
   - note you can "run aws s3" ls at this point (already auth'd)
   - run aws configure
   	- click through security key/secret key
   	- enter region (ie us-west-1)
   - NOTE: if you check ~/.aws it no longer has credentials, but does have config
  ======================================================================================================
  CLI Commands for the Developer Exam Lab
  
  Setup:
	- same setup as above, except give the Role AdminAccess
  	- use run-instances to create a new instance

** This example launches a single instance of type t2.micro into the specified subnet.
The key pair named MyKeyPair and the security group sg-1a2b3c4d must exist.

Command:
   aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-abc12345 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro
     --key-name MyKeyPair --security-group-ids sg-1a2b3c4d --subnet-id subnet-6e7f829e
     
  For Exam: 
  Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/index.html
 
  - know something about how the commands are named
  - Good ones to know
  	- describe-instances
  	- describe-images
  	   - used to describe images available to us
  	- run-instances
  		- used to create instances
  		- See below
  	- start-instances
  		- starts stopped instances 
  	- terminate-instances

=======================================================================================================	
   S3 CLI Regions Lab
 	- create some buckets from different regions in S3
	 - uploads some files to each bucket
 	- Create a EC2 role with S3FullAccess permissions
 	- startup ec2 instance without the roles
 	- log into ec2
 	- double check s3 buckets (aws s3 ls)
 		- should be no access
 	
 	Examples
 	- Copy from within region
 	  aws s3 cp --recursive s3://acloudguru-tj-apsw2 ~/.
 	  
   - Copy from another region
 	  aws s3 cp --recursive s3://acloudguru-tj-apsw2 ~/.  --region eu-west-2
 	 
 	- GOOD Idea - Alwasy use the region flag --region 
 	  		
=======================================================================================================	
  Bash Scripting Lab
  - can add bash commands, but did not work at the ec2 instance config
  - BEST to use a uploaded bash script, worked fine
  - TODO do this and copy files from another regions, best to use a simple index file:

LAB 1 Notes -create a EC2 instance
    
For Exam:
	- Termination Protection is turned off by default
	- On an EBS-Backed instance, the default action is for the root EBS volume
	  to be deleted when the instance is terminated
	- EBS Root Volumees of your DEFAULT AMI's cannot be encypted. HOWEVEr, you can
	  use third party tool (ie bit locker, ect) to encrypt the root volume, or this can be
	  done when creating AMI's in the AWS console or using API
	- Additional volumes can be encrypted
	
=======================================================================================================	

Security Groups Lab:
	Security Group is a Virtual Firewall
	- All inbound traffic is block by default
	- All outbound traffic is allowed
	- changes to a security group apply immediatly
	- you can have multiple EC2 instances within a security group
	- you can have multiple security groupls assigned to one EC2 instance
	- Securtiy Groups are STATEFUL

		  is automatically allowed back out again
   - you CANNOT block specific IP address from Security Grups, only from
     Network Access Control Lists
   - you CAN specify allow rules, CANNOT define a deny rule
